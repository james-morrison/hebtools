Supply the path of a Datawell Waverider buoy data directory containing year 
subfolders, the module will then process the records from the raw files into 
a pandas DataFrame with columns 'sig_qual', 'heave', 'north' and 'west' the 
index is a DateTimeIndex.  

The module will iterate through the months folders in the supplied year 
directory, saving a pandas files in each directory.  

The code skips empty or erroneously long files and each record is rounded to 
the nearest then rounded to the nearest tenth of a second, so the sequence is 
slightly irregular. Caution should be taken in treating the timestamps as 
absolute values, they are a best approximation in the context of the time 
series.  

Peak and Troughs are detected for the heave values and with masking of data 
that has quality issues, wave heights and zero crossing periods are 
calculated.   

Requires Numpy ( numpy.scipy.org ) and Pandas ( pandas.pydata.org )
